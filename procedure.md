# The Ritual

Once the Apocrypha has been established, the eldest Witness must describe the situation at hand, and a charged situation at that.

Go back to the Apocrypha Index you composed and circle 3 to 4 keywords (bodyguards, Riverend, glamour...) or keyphrases (Blood Rose, Miraculous Gates, Sun-Child...). Assign each word or phrase highlighted to a thing:

## Outlining the Ritual

Each Witness must bring forth their share of the Apocrypha, in turns and over each other, as is their wont.

All Witnesses must conduct themselves with utmost respect, care, and understanding of your limits and boundaries. Learn and teach each other when to draw a veil over the Apocrypha, and what lines must not be crossed by any means.

Each Witness will role-play a Spellblade, and all will therefore contribute to the Apocrypha. When secular actors come into play, one of the Witnesses must relay their interaction with the Covenant dispassionately and removed, for as long as they are not acting directly towards their own Spellblade.

When the actions of a Spellblade raise questions as to their outcomes, the dice must come into play. Six-sided dice, rolled all at once, from which the highest resulting pair of dice must be kept.

Should the procedures by which the Witnesses bear their testimony fail to provide clear answers, then the account of the Apocrypha must be regarded to cue in what seems to be the most probable or intuitive course of events.

When that fail, let the Witnesses convene to choose the most probable or intuitive account of the Apocrypha according to their best interests as a group.

## Modus Operandi

There are two procedures codified for the Spellblades within the account of the Apocrypha, and two procedures codified for the Witnesses as they relay their testimony.

**Say**: Describe the word and deed of your Spellblade, as you've witnessed them;
**Do**: With Spell or Blade, witness the result of an outcome in question;
**Know**: Give your testimony about what Intrigue, Tragedy, or Sorcery you've witnessed;
**Doubt**: Demand that other Witnesses testify about what Intrigue, Tragedy, or Sorcery they can attest.

### Try or Test Things

When you want to see how something will turn out, describe what you do and which skill you will apply. Choose whether you are using Spell or Blade.

If you use a skill with Spell, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per checked slot. 

If you use s skill with Blade, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per unchecked slot.

If a weapon mastery or a spell mastery applies, add +1d6 to the pool.

Describe how you do it, roll all dice you can, and add the highest 2 dice together.

- 1-6: miss - the Covenant decides whether you get anything at all from what you set out for, and how badly things go from there;
- 7-9: fumble - turn it into a hit if you pay a cost or lose something relevant, or; you get nothing but the situation won’t get worse either;
- 10-12: hit - you do the thing, or at least you learn how to go about it the best way.

### Know or Decide Things

Spend a token of the appropriate type and describe it.

Offer a token of the appropriate type and ask your question.

**Intrigue**: A new NPC, schemes, groups or organizations;

**Tragedy:** A disaster, plans and ambitions being advanced, a gathering, an interference;

**Sorcery**: The workings or trappings of magic, omens, bargains;

### Learn or Discover Things

Pledge a token of your choice to lure the Covenant into answering a question of yours.

Once someone claims the token, ask your question, and they must answer.

Both the question and the answer must match the kind of token pledged.

Should the token not be claimed, you may decide to cast it into the pit to Know or Decide Things as you desire, or take it back.

[describe or suggest token outcomes like in learn/discover]

### Feel or Express Things

At any time, any member of the Covenant may choose this action to roleplay their character’s reactions, emotions, and thoughts in response to the other approaches.

The long and short of it is that this is a free-form action without cost that can drive the plot onward, expose characters, or just move the story forward.

Simple actions that don't present any serious risk or challenge can also be roleplayed in this fashion (nobody needs to risk rolling their dice to cook breakfast, for example).


# Ruin and Blasphemy

[Consumption, exhaustion, exploited by the powers you wield because wielding that power makes you beholden to the power structures and they do not seek your well-being]
