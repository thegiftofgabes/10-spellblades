## the twist of fate

Once the Apocrypha has been composed, all Witnesses must convene to choose how to circle 3 to 4 keywords (bodyguards, Riverend, glamour...) or keyphrases (Blood Rose, Miraculous Gates, Sun-Child, against enemies of...), and assign each to a twist of fate: a lie, a secret, a trap, an enemy.

# Profile a Spellblade

Follow the steps below to profile a Spellblade.

## Weapon mastery

Record their weapon mastery and the Trait related to it in their Profile.

| Mastery          | Trait    |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| Two-handed blade | powerful |
| Arming blade     | swift    |
| Blade and shield | balanced |
| Dual blades      | bold     |

## Spell focus

| Needle  | Mending     |
| Cane    | Rebuking    |
| Cloak   | Seeming     |
| Mirror  | Revealing   |

## Skills

Record the Spellblade's skills in their profile.

Void hearts weigh in when a Spellblade relies on their Spells, while Laden hearts count towards the use of their Blade.

| Skill       | Hearts |
| ----------- | ----- |
| **Force**   | ♡ ♡ ♡ |
| **Finesse** | ♡ ♡ ♡ |
| **Sense**   | ♡ ♡ ♡ |

## Burdens

Count what Burdens a Spellblade carries at the start of the Ritual.

There are 3 types of Burdens, called Intrigue, Tragedy, and Sorcery. Employ three types of tokens to represent them.

Collect as many Burdens of each kind as you wish, adding to a total of 7.

### Burdens Reference

- **Intrigue**: People, desperately or selfishly, trying to get away with their desires;
- **Tragedy**: Events that invariably snowball into betrayal, death, or worse;
- **Sorcery**: Nature and its spiritual essences, broken or subdued by the want for power over others.

## Yield your Past

Fill in this Spellblade's Name, Pronouns and looks. You may roll two dice to find them below.

**Names** (roll 2d6): 1.1 Dia, 1.2 Bex, 1.3 August, 1.4 Fleur, 1.5 Haven, 1.6 Aden, 2.2 Dew, 2.3 Saylor, 2.4 Vale, 2.5 Ira, 2.6 River, 3.3 Céu, 3.4 Pax, 3.5 Moss, 3.6 Rain, 4.4 Aloe, 4.5 Birch, 4.6 Bloom, 5.5 Fede, 5.6 Soleil, 6.6 Gift.

# The Ritual

Once the Apocrypha has been established, the eldest Witness must describe the situation at hand, and a charged situation at that.

## Outlining the Ritual

Each Witness must bring forth their share of the Apocrypha, in turns and over each other, as is their wont.

All Witnesses must conduct themselves with utmost respect, care, and understanding of each other's limits and boundaries, as well as they're own. 

Learn and teach each other when to draw a veil over the Apocrypha, and what lines must not be crossed by any means.

Each Witness is expected to role-play a Spellblade, as well as contribute to each other's account, and thus contribute to the overall telling of the Apocrypha.

When secular actors come into play, one of the Witnesses must relay their interaction with the Covenant dispassionately and removed, for as long as they are not acting directly towards their own Spellblade.

When the actions of a Spellblade raise questions as to their outcomes, the dice must come into play. Six-sided dice, rolled all at once, from which the highest resulting pair of dice must be kept.

Should the procedures by which the Witnesses bear their testimony fail to provide clear answers, then the account of the Apocrypha must be regarded to cue in what seems to be the most probable or intuitive course of events.

When that fail, let the Witnesses convene to choose the most probable or intuitive account of the Apocrypha according to their best interests as a group.

## Modus Operandi

There are two procedures codified for the Spellblades within the account of the Apocrypha, and two procedures codified for the Witnesses as they relay their testimony.

**Say**: Describe the word and deed of your Spellblade, as you've witnessed them;
**Do**: With Spell or Blade, witness the result of an outcome in question;
**Know**: Give your testimony about what Intrigue, Tragedy, or Sorcery you've witnessed;
**Doubt**: Demand that other Witnesses testify about what Intrigue, Tragedy, or Sorcery they can attest.

### Say

As a Witness, when you roleplay the account of your designated Spellblade, Say what they do, feel, think and know.

As long as the outcomes of their words and deeds are not into question, this is a free-form method of collaboration into the Apocrypha.

### Do

After a Witness has a Say, if the outcomes of a Spellblade's words and deeds are into question, summon the dice to Arbitrate:

To summon arbitration, reach for the dice, and take one to start with.

Decide whether your Spellblade had their way through Spell or Blade.

When relying on Spell, add another die for each void heart, and yet one more if the Aptitude that your Focus inspires applies to this moment.

When relying on Blade, add another die for each burdened die, and yet one more if the Trait that you earned with your Mastery applies at this moment.

Roll every die gathered and dismiss all but the 2 highest rolls. Add them together and resolve their arbitration thus:

- 1-6: Turn to the other Witnesses as they must convene to determine what wicked fate has come to pass. Should you prove their consensus wrong, you must reveal how this Spellblade has spiralled towards Ruin or Blasphemy, then procede as if you had rolled a 10.
- 7-9: You describe the outcome in question as you would see fit, then turn to the other Witnesses. One of them must step forward to describe what twist, unforeseen cost, or unexpected event that also comes to pass.
- 10-12: You describe the outcome in question as you find appropriate. You may even request another Witness to add to it should the final result be 12. Accept or dismiss their contribution as you see fit.

### Know

Forfeit a Burden of yours to introduce a previous unknown fact to the Apocrypha, or an actor that was previously unaccounted for.

Recount this new fact according to the Burden you gave up, Tragedy, Intrigue, or Sorcery.

Should you introduce a new actor, create a short record of them into an index card and hold on to it for as long as the recounting of the current scene lasts. You are responsible for this actor, their words and deeds, until then.

### Doubt

Pledge a Burden of your choice to lure another Witness into answering a question of yours.

Once they claim the Burden, ask your question, and they must answer. Both the question and the answer must match the kind of Burden pledged.

Should the token not be claimed, you may take it back, or decide to cast it away to reveal what you Knew all along.

# Blasphemy and Ruin

Consumption, exhaustion. Exploited by the powers you wield because wielding that power makes you beholden to Power Structures that seek self-preservation above all, and that do not seek your well-being, you are now a shade of whom you once were.

You are a Witness, and you've come to pen the tale your own slow, certain demise.

When you reveal your own Blasphemy or Ruin, check which option fits the matter at hand and reveal what happened. Each option is only valid once.

## Blasphemy

- [ ] your Focus is scattered, spent, or lost to you;
- [ ] you are cursed, and none dare look you in the eye or start conversation;
- [ ] you sullied your Covenant's reputation;
- [ ] you broke a heart or took the spark from someone's soul;
- [ ] your soul has been consumed, and a heart beats in an empty shell.

Your heart telegraphs away its last beats in a cool, detestable chamber, where it slowly rots in the hands of a crooked Magistre.

## Ruin

- [ ] your Blade lies broken, dulled, or impossible to lift;
- [ ] you doled out pain and suffering with abandon;
- [ ] you brought ruin to an innocent bystander;
- [ ] you've destroyed something good or beautiful;
- [ ] your body is exhausted, broken, and it gave.

Now your brains lie in a bowl, as a Holy-Manne drains your testimony from it, dissecating your immortal soul one word at a time.

---

When the Ritual ends, collect all Records, Profiles, all traces of the tale that has been told, and find a secret, hidden place where none shall find it, but where you *could* access it again, should the need to draw knowledge from it arise.
