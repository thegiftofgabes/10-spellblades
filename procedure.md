# The Ritual

Once the Apocrypha has been established, the eldest Witness must describe the situation at hand, and a charged situation at that.

Go back to the Apocrypha you composed and circle 3 to 4 keywords (bodyguards, Riverend, glamour...) or keyphrases (Blood Rose, Miraculous Gates, Sun-Child...). Assign each word or phrase highlighted to a thing:



## Try or Test Things

When you want to see how something will turn out, describe what you do and which skill you will apply. Choose whether you are using Spell or Blade.

If you use a skill with Spell, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per checked slot. 

If you use s skill with Blade, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per unchecked slot.

If a weapon mastery or a spell mastery applies, add +1d6 to the pool.

Describe how you do it, roll all dice you can, and add the highest 2 dice together.

- 1-6: miss - the Covenant decides whether you get anything at all from what you set out for, and how badly things go from there;
- 7-9: fumble - turn it into a hit if you pay a cost or lose something relevant, or; you get nothing but the situation won’t get worse either;
- 10-12: hit - you do the thing, or at least you learn how to go about it the best way.

## Know or Decide Things

Spend a token of the appropriate type and describe it.

Offer a token of the appropriate type and ask your question.

**Intrigue**: A new NPC, schemes, groups or organizations;

**Tragedy:** A disaster, plans and ambitions being advanced, a gathering, an interference;

**Sorcery**: The workings or trappings of magic, omens, bargains;

## Learn or Discover Things

Pledge a token of your choice to lure the Covenant into answering a question of yours.

Once someone claims the token, ask your question, and they must answer.

Both the question and the answer must match the kind of token pledged.

Should the token not be claimed, you may decide to cast it into the pit to Know or Decide Things as you desire, or take it back.

[describe or suggest token outcomes like in learn/discover]

## Feel or Express Things

At any time, any member of the Covenant may choose this action to roleplay their character’s reactions, emotions, and thoughts in response to the other approaches.

The long and short of it is that this is a free-form action without cost that can drive the plot onward, expose characters, or just move the story forward.

Simple actions that don't present any serious risk or challenge can also be roleplayed in this fashion (nobody needs to risk rolling their dice to cook breakfast, for example).


# Ruin and Blasphemy

[Consumption, exhaustion, exploited by the powers you wield because wielding that power makes you beholden to the power structures and they do not seek your well-being]
