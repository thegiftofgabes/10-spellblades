Gameplay Structure

The game follows a musical structure.

The game is heavily improvisational, so feel free

to shift between these sections and make

amendments to them as suits the needs of your

group.

Intro

The intro sets the tone for the episode, giving

some time for each main character to go about

their lives and eventually come together.

Exposition

The exposition section introduces the goal and

the stakes for the episode. Everyone works

together to make these. The higher the stakes,

the higher the reward.

Development

Each party member gets a few scenes in the

spotlight, moving towards the goal and wrestling

with the stakes.

Bridge

During the bridge, everyone regroups and builds

toward the final climax of the session.

Refrain

Everyone finds out if the goal is reached, and

what it costs them.

Coda

Everyone gets a look at the new status quo,

wraps up loose ends, and thinks about what lies

ahead.

Intro

The intro is like the part of a show before the

opening credits. It shows us how the members of

the party spend their time between episodes.

The opener could be as simple as everyone sitting

together and talking about the events of the last

episode, or it could be a montage of each party

member going about their daily lives.

First, establish the season: winter, spring,

summer, or fall.

Then, starting with the oldest character and

moving down to the youngest, each player

describes where their character is, what they’re

doing, and how it tells us something about their

character.

Exposition

In the exposition section, everyone converges and

decides what the session will be about. Together,

decide on a GOAL and the STAKES.

The GOAL: the goal should be something

achievable within the session but could have a

continuation in a future session. It could be as

simple as “travel through the Candlewood

Forest” or as grand as “take down the tyrant

king.” Either way, there must be danger.

The STAKES: the stakes should match the goal.

If the goal is simple, the stakes are probably low.

If the goal is grand, the stakes are probably high.

The stakes should logically follow from the goal.

When travelling through the Candlewood Forest,

the stakes might be “getting hopelessly lost.”

When attempting to depose a tyrant king, the

stakes might be “everyone dying.” Then, rate the

stakes on a scale of 1 to 4:

1. Low: getting lost, scrapes, bruises.

2. Medium: broken bones, lost money.

3. High: a party member or important NPC

dying, the fate of an entire village or

town.

4. Incredible: the fate of the entire party or

an entire kingdom.

Whether or not the goal is achieved, mark as

much XP as the stakes’ rating at the end of the

session.

Development

During the development phase, the spotlight

shifts from player to player, giving each party

member some time to shine. This doesn’t mean

that two (or more) party members can’t be in the

same scene, just that the story is focusing on one

character while the others play supporting roles.

Each scene during the action could represent as

little time as a half hour or span multiple days.

Just be sure to note how much time passed

during your scene when it’s over.

Decide who gets the spotlight first by figuring

out which character is likely to put the most

momentum into completing the goal. If your

character is highly invested in the outcome of the

episode, they should go first! More aloof

characters should follow.

During Development

When it’s your turn to be the lead character,

you’re playing the Melody, and you get to pick

someone to be your Countermelody. Everyone

else plays the Orchestra. The role of the

Countermelody player is to portray NPCs and

the world while the Melody player portrays their

character and takes action. The Orchestra gives

suggestions and ideas, and the Countermelody

can defer roleplaying of certain characters onto

the Orchestra.

To begin, the Melody player establishes where

they are, and shares three key details about the

location, such as:

- What time of day is it? What’s the

weather?

- What kind of a place is this? How do

we know?

- Who else is here? How do they react to

the PC?

- What interesting sights, sounds, or

scents does this place have?

- What kind of danger is present in this

place?

After the Melody player establishes the scene

and their goals, the Countermelody player

describes, narrates, and roleplays any obstacles

or opponents in the way.

If anything demands the dice be rolled (see How

to Play), roll them.

At the climax of your scene, make the Crucial

Moment move and take note of the outcome.

You’ll gain or lose Power based on the outcome.

Once your goals have been completed or your

hopes have been dashed, nominate another

player to carry the Melody, and keep going!

Bridge

Once everyone has had some time playing the

melody, it’s time for the bridge.

During the bridge, everyone summarizes what

happened during the development phase, and

their characters meet up again if they were

separated. Note how much Power your party

holds.

If the goal for the session is close, move on to the

Refrain. Else, keep playing in the Development

stage until you want to move on.

Refrain

The refrain is the section of the game where your

party converges on the goal and determines

whether it’s achieved. The last person to play the

Melody establishes where the climax takes place

and who should act first.

Once per session, if a party member introduces a

cool twist or callback to a character’s

background during the refrain, gain 1 Power.

The Refrain always centers around a major set

piece or emotional moment:

- Fighting in a large-scale battle in the war

(whose side are you on? Do they even

know who you are?)

- Evacuating a town during a blitz (who or

what can’t be left behind?)

- Doing battle on a large airship (maybe

while it’s sinking from the sky?)

- A chase across the rooftops of one of the

major cities (are you running from the

guards? Soldiers?)

- A tense negotiation bathed in firelight

(with who, or what? Are you speaking for

yourselves, or someone else?)

6

After the scene has been set, everyone goes

around describing how they attempt to meet the

goal, or set up someone else to meet the goal,

making the Reach for the Stars move. Once

you’re done, pass the spotlight to someone else.

Once everyone has played their part, come

together and choose someone appropriate to roll

for the Moment of Truth, where your party

makes its final make-or-break effort to secure the

goal.

The Moment of Truth determines whether you

achieve your goal or if your efforts were in vain.

Roll 2d6+Power to find out the results!

- 12+: you reach the goal and then some!

(You corral the soldiers to storm the

castle, you get to read the wizard’s spell

book, or you gain honors from the king,

etc.)

- 10-11: you achieve the goal flat out.
- 7-9: you achieve the goal, but you must

sacrifice something dear to you.

- 6-: you fail. You choke at the last second

or were doomed to fail from the start.

Maybe it was fate, or maybe someone just

messed up. Describe what goes wrong.

Coda

The coda is where the session wraps up. We get a

glimpse of the characters’ new normal, and

everyone tracks their XP. Like the intro, we get a

montage or ensemble scene where we see how

the session’s events have affected the party.

Starting with whoever rolled the Moment of

Truth, each player describes where their party

member ends up, what they’re doing, how the

session’s events changed them.

Then, everyone marks as much XP as the stakes

rating, and levels up if appropriate.
