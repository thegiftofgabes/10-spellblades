# Rolling Dice

When you attempt something dangerous, tricky or chancy, tell the DM how you want to do it, and which skill you will apply. Choose whether you are using Spell or Blade.

If you use a skill with Spell, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per checked slot. 

If you use s skill with Blade, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per unchecked slot.

If a weapon mastery or a spell mastery apply, add +1d6 to the pool.

Describe how you do it, roll all dice you can, and add the highest 2 dice together.

- 1-6: miss - the Covenant decides whether you get anything at all from what you set out for, and how badly things go from there;
- 7-9: fumble - turn it into a hit if you pay a cost or lose something relevant, or; you get nothing but the situation won’t get worse either;
- 10-12: hit - you do the thing, or at least you learn how to go about it the best way.
