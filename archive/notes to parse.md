something breaks, or is pushed away, out of reach.
the poor, sodden work done is revealed, or the cost is much higher than anticipated.
so much time is wasted, or the work hasn't been as thorough as one thought.

This is the account of such Spellblades, as they were known, relayed by Witnesses ~~bound by oath and chain to testify truly and unerringly, for these are true facts that shall enter the history, but to what benefit remains to be known.~~

# DESIGN: ITEMS FOR CLOSURE

I WANT TO KNOW (DECIDE) SOMETHING: 

The player wants to introduce a new fact about the world and adventure your characters are inhabiting. To do this, they surrender a token that they feel is relevant to the thing they want to invent or decide. 

If they want to introduce an NPC to the rest of the party, they can spend a People token, but the token stays in front of them for as long as the NPC remains active, and they control the NPC's reactions to the party. They only lose the token when the party decide the NPC has helped them as much as they can. 

I WANT TO LEARN OR DISCOVER SOMETHING: The player wants to ask a question about the world and the adventure, and someone else will answer. To do this, they take a token of a relevant type. They can choose to hand it to another player to get them to invent the answer to the question, or they can open it to the floor and whoever picks up the token will answer the question. Once the token is taken, the player asks their question. For example, if there is a mysterious box, a player might say "I want to discover something." By picking a People token they are suggesting a person is in the box, or knows what is in the box. By choosing a Nature token, they would be saying that the box contains something associated with the natural world. By choosing an Event token they would be saying that the contents are important to a past or future event, or that the box and its contents being placed there is important. They only reveal they are asking about the box and its contents after they have chosen their token (they might have wanted to learn about the room, for example). Answering someone's Learn or Discover question is the only way to gain tokens, so players are encouraged to ask each other to define the world in this way to make for a variety of descriptions.
### Try or Test Things

When you want to see how something will turn out, describe what you do and which skill you will apply. Choose whether you are using Spell or Blade.

If you use a skill with Spell, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per checked slot. 

If you use s skill with Blade, roll 1d6 + 1d6 per unchecked slot.

If a weapon mastery or a spell mastery applies, add +1d6 to the pool.

Describe how you do it, roll all dice you can, and add the highest 2 dice together.

- 1-6: miss - the Covenant decides whether you get anything at all from what you set out for, and how badly things go from there;
- 7-9: fumble - turn it into a hit if you pay a cost or lose something relevant, or; you get nothing but the situation won’t get worse either;
- 10-12: hit - you do the thing, or at least you learn how to go about it the best way.

### Know or Decide Things

Spend a token of the appropriate type and describe it.

Offer a token of the appropriate type and ask your question.

**Intrigue**: A new NPC, schemes, groups or organizations;

**Tragedy:** A disaster, plans and ambitions being advanced, a gathering, an interference;

**Sorcery**: The workings or trappings of magic, omens, bargains;

### Learn or Discover Things

Pledge a token of your choice to lure the Covenant into answering a question of yours.

Once someone claims the token, ask your question, and they must answer.

Both the question and the answer must match the kind of token pledged.

Should the token not be claimed, you may decide to cast it into the pit to Know or Decide Things as you desire, or take it back.

[describe or suggest token outcomes like in learn/discover]

### Feel or Express Things

At any time, any member of the Covenant may choose this action to roleplay their character’s reactions, emotions, and thoughts in response to the other approaches.

The long and short of it is that this is a free-form action without cost that can drive the plot onward, expose characters, or just move the story forward.

Simple actions that don't present any serious risk or challenge can also be roleplayed in this fashion (nobody needs to risk rolling their dice to cook breakfast, for example).
